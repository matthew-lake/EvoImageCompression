# EvoImageCompression
An image compression algorithm that uses evolutionary/genetic programming techniques. 2013 Young ICT Explorers State Finalist. See [Wiki](https://github.com/matthew-lake/EvoImageCompression/wiki) for details.

## About
I wrote this with [Joseph Garrone](https://github.com/josephgarrone) for the 2013 Young ICT Explorers competition, where it was a state finalist. The aim of this algorithm was to create a lossless but space-efficient image compression algorithm, in in that we largely succeeded, storing lossless images with filesizes 10 - 15% smaller than compressed PNGs. In hindsight, however, we probably bit off more than we could chew, with very lengthy running times.

Our work built off the 7-Zip SDK (public domain) and Roger Alsing's EvoLisa (LGPL).

## Warning: Here be dragons
This code may be buggy, ugly, or may not even compile. I have not run it in several years, and it was touch and go at the time. 

I last worked on it in Year 12 - safe to say I've learnt a lot since then. Accordingly, it's a bit of mess.
